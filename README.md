### Intro

Fluidigrid is a simple and lightweight CSS helper for building quick and efficient layouts.

### Getting started

- You can copy the [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fluiditype/Fluidigrid/main/fluidigrid.css) file and add it to your project.
- You can use the [Fluidigrid Generator] (cssgenerator) to create your own naming convention for custom experience.
- You can standart link or import via PostCSS
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="boriskirov.cc/fluidigrid.css">`
  `import styles from 'boriskirov.cc/fluidigrid.css'`

### Structure

Fluidigrid setup is simple, it is based on 12 column `grid-template-columns`. Each of the 12 cells are using the `fr` (fractional unit). When going belowe `1024px` the layout switches the `1fr`.

### How to use

You can create your own `grid` html element or add a class `.grid` to the wrapper you want to create the grid layout. Then you should declare start and values for each of your columns to create the layout. Fluidigrid comes with pre-declared naming convention, we use `cs{n}` for column-start-{column number} and `ce{n}` for column-end-{column number}. For example if you want to declare a column which starts from the first to last column you will declare `cs1 ce12`.
